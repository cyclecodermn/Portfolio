Managing Flooring Products

Soon before this project, I started learning OOP, the benefits of a layered architecture, and last, I had just learned how to use MS Visual Studio. I applied these skills by creating all the CRUD functions for a fictitious company that makes flooring products. Since the focus of this project was using OOP and a layered architecture, this is a console application.

This was an early mastery project when I was an apprentice at the Software Guild. It was not a tutorial since we were given no instructions to follow when creating the project. Instead, I created the project from scratch using similar yet different projects.

Requirements of this project are listed below.

o We are using a layered architecture for this project. Therefore, your code must be organized into reasonable classes and split into UI, Data, Models, and BLL projects.
o Any time a user enters invalid data, the system should ask them again until they enter valid data. A user should not be able to crash the application with invalid data.
o Please submit your project plan with your code. This can be flowcharts, outlines, pseudocode, or any other documentation and planning technique.
o You must unit test your BLL and Data layers.
